Tried to replicate basic sync functionality using python on creation or updation in a directory

1. Create one folder and put the exe file with config.txt file (need to have github account and generate token DO NOT SHARE THAT TOKEN)
2. Run the exe file incase git is not installed it will install it and terminate
3. Set up the user and email in git config using the below commands<br/>

 `
 git config --global user.name <username>
 `
 <br/>
 `
 git config --global user.email <email>
 `
 <br/>
4. Rerun again and make changes in the folder mentioned in config.txt to see the changes

4. Once you're happy you can add it in startup programs so that it will automatically start when the pc is turned on make sure you do not close the terminal window once it pops else you'll have to manually start it again<br/>
(To add in start up programs follow the below steps 
- use Win + R
- Type shell:startup
- Create Shortcut of the main.exe)

Enjoy üòÅ
